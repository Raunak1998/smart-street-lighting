## ABSTRACT
Lighting is one the most power-hungry component anywhere across globe both in commercial as well as domestic use. It is the biggest contributor in energy bills to the state exchanger for operating & maintaining the street light across the city or state therefore it becomes the choice for implementing latest energy efficient technologies. City administrator are open and key to adopt new products & technologies which will help them save energy & reduce their power bills significantly.
The light industry is already introducing & implementing energy efficient LED technologies which reduce energy consumption significantly. This would further cut down by the use of cutting-edge Internet of Things concept. We have developed IoT based wireless controller & software platform to control & manage streetlights or commercial facilities lights. We use platform state of the art and wireless mesh technology to convert these lights locally and then connect to the cloud via some Wi-Fi internet gateway. The data on the cloud platform helps the user or concerned authority to monitor, control & manage these assets in real time and cut down energy bills by efficient use through smart scheme usage or traffic pattern.
